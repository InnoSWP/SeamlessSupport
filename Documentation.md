# Overview 

A simple tool for seamless customer support across platforms by a volunteer team 

## Motivation 

Today, there are many platforms that more and more people use. It's not always the case that platforms have documentation available to resolve users' ever-increasing questions. But no need to worry - Seamless Support is already coming for help! With Seamless Support,you can easily add customer support and the ability to answer all your questions to volunteers, which will make using your product easier and make the customer happier - isn't that what we want? 

## What is Seamless Support? 

Seamless support is a project focused on providing users with the ability to quickly and easily integrate customer support services into their product.This project provides the following functionality: 

1. Providing a single platform for customer support. 

2. Possibility to integrate theservice into existing applications,allowing customers to provide feedback. 

3. Possibility for volunteers to answer questions in the existing service(Telegram) without the need to create a separate application.

# Installation 

## Python

This project is written on [Python 3.10](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-3104/). It is important to have `PYTHON` added to the `PATH` to run the project from the console.

## Libraries required

Front-end : we just need to install the socket-io library and run the code or import it if you used Ajax like our project

## How to create database 

## How to set up database 

## How to set up bot 

## How to set up env variables 

## How to launch server and bot 

* * *


# How does the project works 

The interface of the system consists of two parts: frontend part for clients that want to ask questions on some service, and telegram part - where volunteers can answer asked questions.

## For clients 

In the service that uses our project client needs: 

1. Login into their own account.

2. Find a chat window with the support service.

3. Ask questions.

## For volunteers 

In telegram volunteers need to be added in the chanell with questions, then the procedure of answering questions occur in several easy steps:

1. Open the channel with questions.

2. Choose the questions that you are able to answer and click button ‘Answer the question’

3. Once you have accepted the question, bot will write to you saying that you have a new dialog in your own chat, and if you did it accidentally, then you can cancel it.

4. After refreshing the page with dialogs, volunteers will see new dialog in it with this question.

5. Then the volunteer can choose the dialog he wants to be in. Here he can answer the question by writing a message in telegram, go to another dialog (‘Go back’ button) or close the question (‘Finish dialog’ button).

6. Once the volunteer finishes dialog, the question will disappear from the questions list.

# About us 

## Development team 

**Polina Zelenskaya** - team leader and telegram bot developer. Responsible For teamwork, management, telegram bot,and connection of program logic with the database. 

**Laith Alebrahim** - front end developer. Responsible for the design part of the project,client’s interface. 

## Software testing 

**Ruslan Abdullin** - tester designer. Do everything to break the development team's service. 

## Project management 

**Evgeny Gerasimov** - scrum master. Responsible for better interaction between team members, for presenting and documenting the project. 

## Stages of development 

To manage the project, we used theScrum methodology and broke down the stages of project creation into weekly sprints. Sprint description 

### Sprint 1 

**Sprint goal** - meet with the team and create a plan of the project 

1. Use-case diagram 

2. User stories 

3. Product backlog 

**Outcome of the sprint:**

*Functionality:*

1. We found out that our project MVP (version 1) require: 

1. Registration to start dialogue 

2. Ability to ask questions on thesite 

3. Ability to answer questions in telegram 

2. Preferable Features: 

1. Automatic question canceling 

2. Automate Frequent questions

*Prototype findings:*

1. When we discussed volunteers interface, we found problem that questions 

that bot send in chat could be missed (bot sent message, several people in 

chat written some messages,as a result message will be lost). 

We Found several solutions to this problem: 

1. Pin questions in chat, so volunteers will have opportunity to seeall 

of them 

2. Replace group to channel.So no-one except bot will have access to 

send messages,and no question will be lost. 

2. During our discussion we found out that the customer need to seethe 

history of message.Thesolution of this problem is to ask client to register 

in order to ask questions,and to see answers to their problems.So our 

database will also store users (e.g.email, phone number, telegram aliasl) to 

make a link between the client and their chat history 

### Sprint 2 

**Sprint goal** - create MVP that will contain: 

1. Some graphical interface(any) 

2. Basic database(no volunteers statistics, no user sessions) 

3. Simpletelegram bot to manage questions (+ ability to answer them as one message) 

4. API that will connect bot, frontend and database 

**Outcome of the sprint:**

*Front-End Part outcomes:*

1. We made float chat to contact with supporter 

2. We Checked the email if it’s correct email (username,@ and ( . ) before the suffix ) 

3. We used "Socket" library to connect theapi with thechat 

Telegram bot part outcomes: 

4. Bot write introduction message (with instructions of the final configuration step) 

when he is added to the channel. 

5. Bot send new questions to the channel with buttons for acceptance. 

6. Bot show what questions are not accepted yet,and what questions are in progress. 

7. Bot managethatvolunteers couldn't accept in progress questions. 

8. Bot manages that he doesn't have permission to write volunteers and throws an alert 

so that volunteers should start dialogue. 

9. Bot provide an opportunity to cancel selected questions. 

10. Bot send a start message when a new volunteer starts the chat. 

*Database outcomes:*

1. Firebase database connection and basic tables are created. 

*API outcomes:*

1. Requests to manage databases automatically. 

2. WebSockets to send chat messages seamlessly. 

### Sprint 3 

**Sprint goal** - finish MVP (connect everything with glue): 

1. Graphical interface as floating window (+ message deletion) 

2. Database v1 (question/answer is stored, however dialogues not supported) 

3. Telegram bot v1 (ability to answer questions, to save volunteers data, design dialogue implementation) API v1 (everything above but connected) 

**Outcome of the sprint:**

*Front-End Part outcomes:*

1. We Connected the front-end with the backend and made a short test by sending a message to the bot to reply to it. 

2. We Fixed some problem in design (When we close the float chat the visibility of the chat will not close completely) 

*Telegram bot part outcomes:*

1. Bot now works with API. 

2. Bot could acceptanswers from volunteers (and send them to API). 

3. Bug with bot.close() request fixed. 

4. Bot could send messages to the channel without the /ask command. 

5. Bot functionality is fully documented. 

*Database outcomes:*

1. Firebase Connection with API implemented. 

API outcomes: 

2. Sockets support implemented. 

3. Frontend works flawlessly with API. 

4. API could work with bot. 

### Sprint 4 

**Sprint goal** - document code, add comments, present MVP and learn how to extract keywords from sentences on different languages (for frequent questions part)

**Outcome of the sprint:**

1. We managed to create our MVP:

      1.1 Connect Frontend with API

2. We met with the customer and discussed progress. It allowed us to change our work process to be more preferable for ****customer****.

## Interaction with client 

In the beginning of each sprint we met our customer to share the results in our project with him. Customers always gave us useful feedback that helped us to improve our project and add new useful features. 

## Difficulties 

The main difficulty during our project is that by our system we want to cover needs of two different types of users - software engineers as people who may want to integrate our system in their projectand direct users of the concrete integrated system.To meet the needs of all users the code should be maintainable and functionally complete. It means that: 

1. Code Should be modular, so all developers could add some new features in their project. 

2. System should have a friendly interface, so that every user of the system could find and answer questions easily, without any loss of questions/answers. Interface Should beclean. 

3. System should have all needed for conversation features, the user should be able to write messages,attach files, send voice or video messages,add codesippets or math formulas. 

On all of the above mentioned points our team had several weeks. It is clear that it is impossible to cover all these features in such an amount of time.So we needed to work hard to cover most of them. 

## Status of the project 

As was mentioned before, the area of application of this project is wide, so there's still a lot of work to do. However, our team is glad to say that the most important things are already done and wait for further improvement. 

## Are we keeping up with the deadlines? 

For now we did almost everything that we planned to do till the end of this month. All parts are already ready to use, the only thing that remains is to connectall of them.
