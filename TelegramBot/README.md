# Telegram Bot

### Getting started

First it is required to configure environment variables.

Create in this (`TelegramBot`) folder `.env` file and insert there lines:
```dotenv
BOT_TOKEN=1111111111:AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
CHANNEL_ID=-1000000000000
```
* To get your personal `BOT_TOKEN` create bot in [Bot father](https://t.me/BotFather). After configuration reboot your bot.
* To get `CHANNEL_ID` add bot to your channel, and you will see [this message](#channel-id-message) that will show your channel's id. After you will configure your `.env` file, reboot bot.
